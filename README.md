## Project Proposal: Analyzing Factors Influencing Formula 1 Race Results (2010-2024)  

### Motivation  
Formula 1 is one of the most data-driven sports in the world, where strategy, driver skill, and external conditions combine to determine race outcomes.  
While qualifying results provide a strong indication of potential race performance, numerous other factors such as pit stop strategies, driver experience, and weather conditions play crucial roles.  

For instance, an aggressive pit strategy can allow a driver to gain track position, while sudden weather changes can disrupt race strategies entirely.  
Additionally, experienced drivers may demonstrate better adaptability during chaotic race conditions, further influencing results.  

This project aims to explore these factors and their combined impact on race outcomes by analyzing F1 data from 2010 to 2024.

### Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to analyze how:  
- Qualifying Results  
- Pit Stop Strategies  
- Driver's Age and Experience  
- Weather Conditions  

...influence the final race results in Formula 1 by analyzing races held between 2010 and 2024.  

### Data Collection Plan  
For a comprehensive and accurate analysis, I will use multiple reliable data sources:  

1. **[Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/)**  
   - Extract data on race results, qualifying performance, and pit stop details through API queries.  
   - Focus on races from **2010 to 2024** for consistency.  

2. **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)**  
   - Collect weather data for each race weekend to analyze environmental conditions.  
   - Additional data for driver experience and age information.  

3. **[Official FIA Website](https://www.fia.com/)**  
   - Use official FIA reports to validate race incidents, weather conditions, and pit strategy insights.    

### Data Analysis  
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and merging datasets from multiple sources.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and visualizing trends in qualifying results, pit strategies, and race outcomes.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating the strength of relationships between qualifying positions, pit stops, weather, and race outcomes.  
- **Regression Models:** Building predictive models to evaluate the combined influence of these factors.
- **Visualization:** To effectively present the relationship between the factors like qualifying, weather condititons, driver performances and race results. Scatter plots, line graphs, heatmaps, bar charts will be used.
